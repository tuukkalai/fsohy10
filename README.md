# Full Stack open - React Native

## Development

```sh
npm start
# scan QR code or run with Android Emulator or iOS Simulator
# reload the app with `r`
```

## Possible issues

Running and developing the app on a new machine (no previous version of `.env`), the `app.config.js` does not seem to read the environmental variables. -> fix: clear cache and run: `npx expo start --clear`
